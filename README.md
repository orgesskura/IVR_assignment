# IVR_assignment
Assignment for Introduction to Vision and Robotics.

We had a robot with 4 revolute joints having different colours. We had multiple tasks for the project and the main ones were:

-Given rotation angles as function of time, we had to detect the joint angles through computer vision only.

-Given that an orange sphere and a box were moving around, we had to detect the position of the orange sphere.

-Using closed-loop control and a PD controller, we had to make the tip of the robot go towards the orange sphere.

The full specifications of the coursework can be found in IVR_Assignment(1).pdf . The task was solved in python and OpenCV was used for image processing. For robot control we were required to use ROS.


Part 2 is run through image2.py and Part 3 is run through image1.py. We choose 4.1 and it is run by image3.py.
